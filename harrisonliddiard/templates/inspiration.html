        <h2>If&mdash;</h2>
        <h3 class="author">Rudyard Kipling</h3>
        <p>If you can keep your head when all about you <br /> Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br /> But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br /> Or being lied about, don&rsquo;t deal in lies,<br />Or being hated, don&rsquo;t give way to hating,<br /> And yet don&rsquo;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
        <p>If you can dream&mdash;and not make dreams your master; <br /> If you can think&mdash;and not make thoughts your aim; <br />If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br /> And treat those two impostors just the same; <br />If you can bear to hear the truth you&rsquo;ve spoken<br /> Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br /> And stoop and build &rsquo;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
        <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br /> And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br /> And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br /> To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br /> Except the Will which says to them: &lsquo;Hold on!&rsquo;</p>
        <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br /> Or walk with Kings&mdash;nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br /> If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br /> With sixty seconds&rsquo; worth of distance run, <br />Yours is the Earth and everything that&rsquo;s in it, <br /> And&mdash;which is more&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be a Man, my son!</p>

        <h2>It Couldn&rsquo;t Be Done</h2>
        <h3 class="author">Edgar A. Guest</h3>
        <p>Somebody said that it couldn&rsquo;t be done<br /> But he with a chuckle replied<br />That &ldquo;maybe it couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; but he would be one<br /> Who wouldn&rsquo;t say so till he&rsquo;d tried.<br />So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin<br /> On his face. If he worried he hid it.<br />He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br /> That couldn&rsquo;t be done, and he did it!</p>
        <p>Somebody scoffed: &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll never do that;<br /> At least no one ever has done it;&rdquo;<br />But he took off his coat and he took off his hat<br /> And the first thing we knew he&rsquo;d begun it.<br />With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,<br /> Without any doubting or quiddit,<br />He started to sing as he tackled the thing<br /> That couldn&rsquo;t be done, and he did it.</p>
        <p>There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,<br /> There are thousands to prophesy failure,<br />There are thousands to point out to you one by one,<br /> The dangers that wait to assail you.<br />But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,<br /> Just take off your coat and go to it;<br />Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing<br /> That &ldquo;cannot be done,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

        <h2>Ecclesiastes 3</h2>
        <h3 class="author">King James Version</h3>
        <p><span class="verse-number">1</span> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">2</span> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">3</span> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">4</span> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">5</span> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">6</span> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">7</span> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">8</span> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
        <p><span class="verse-number">9</span> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</p>
        &vellip;
        <p><span class="verse-number">12</span> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>
